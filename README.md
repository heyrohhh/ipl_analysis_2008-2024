# Cricket Performance Analytics Project

This project analyzes cricket data to provide insights on player performance, team victories, and season-wise trends using Python. It uses datasets for deliveries and matches to aggregate performance data and generate visualizations.

## 📊 Features:

* **Top 10 Batsmen by Total Runs**: Identifies the highest run-scorers across all seasons.
* **Top 10 Bowlers by Wickets**: Ranks the bowlers based on the total number of wickets taken.
* **Top 5 Teams with Most Wins**: Displays the teams that have won the most matches in the dataset.
* **Top 5 Batsmen by Average Score in the Last 5 Seasons**: Shows the batsmen with the highest average scores over the last 5 seasons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* CSV Files

## 📂 Dataset:

* `deliveries.csv`: Contains information on individual deliveries in each match.
* `matches.csv`: Holds the metadata about matches including the teams and the winner.

## 📈 Data Insights:

The script allows users to view key performance metrics by selecting one of the following options:

1. Top 10 Batsmen by Total Runs
2. Top 10 Bowlers by Wickets
3. Most Winning Teams
4. Top Batsmen by Average Score in the Last 5 Seasons

Each option presents the data in a graphical format, providing a comprehensive analysis of the performance trends.

## 📌 How to Use:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the necessary libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```
4. Place the `deliveries.csv` and `matches.csv` files in the same directory as the script.
5. Run the script, select an option, and view the results.
